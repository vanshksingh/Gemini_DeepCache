  "What is Wikipedia and what is its primary purpose?": "**What is Wikipedia?**\n\nWikipedia is a **free, online, collaborative encyclopedia**. It is the largest and most widely used general reference work on the internet.\n\nKey characteristics of Wikipedia include:\n\n*   **Online:** It exists digitally and is accessible via the internet.\n*   **Free:** All of its content is freely available to anyone with an internet connection, and it is supported by donations, primarily through the Wikimedia Foundation.\n*   **Collaborative:** It is written and maintained by a massive community of volunteer editors worldwide. Anyone with an internet connection can typically contribute or edit its articles (within certain guidelines and policies).\n*   **Multilingual:** It is available in hundreds of different languages, with the English Wikipedia being the largest version.\n*   **General Reference:** It aims to cover every topic of human knowledge, from history and science to pop culture and current events.\n*   **Wiki-based:** It uses \"wiki\" software, which allows for articles to be easily created and edited directly through a web browser.\n*   **Non-profit:** It is hosted and operated by the Wikimedia Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to encouraging the growth, development, and distribution of free, multilingual educational content.\n\n**What is its primary purpose?**\n\nWikipedia's primary purpose is to **create and disseminate a free, openly licensed, and accessible compendium of human knowledge.**\n\nMore simply, it aims to **make the sum of all human knowledge available to everyone, everywhere, for free.**\n\nThis purpose is underpinned by several core principles:\n\n1.  **Accessibility:** To break down barriers (financial, geographical, linguistic) to information and knowledge.\n2.  **Neutrality:** To present information factually and without bias (known as the \"Neutral Point of View\" policy).\n3.  **Verifiability:** To ensure that all information can be verified through reliable sources.\n4.  **Collaboration:** To harness the collective intelligence of a global community to build and maintain this vast repository of information.\n\nIn essence, Wikipedia seeks to be a universal, comprehensive, and continuously evolving resource for factual information, serving as a fundamental tool for learning and understanding the world.",
  "Who founded Wikipedia and when was it launched?": "Wikipedia was founded by **Jimmy Wales** and **Larry Sanger**.\n\nIt was officially launched on **January 15, 2001**.",
  "How many languages is Wikipedia available in as of July 8, 2025?": "I cannot provide the exact number of languages Wikipedia will be available in on July 8, 2025, as that date is in the future and the number can fluctuate over time. New language editions are occasionally launched.\n\nHowever, as of early 2024, Wikipedia is available in **336** languages. You can expect the number on July 8, 2025, to be very close to this figure, likely 336 or slightly higher.",
  "Where are Wikipedia\u2019s headquarters located?": "Wikipedia itself is an online encyclopedia and doesn't have a physical \"headquarters\" in the traditional sense. However, it is operated by the **Wikimedia Foundation**, a non-profit organization.\n\nThe Wikimedia Foundation's headquarters are located in **San Francisco, California, USA**.",
  "Which organization owns and operates Wikipedia?": "Wikipedia is owned and operated by the **Wikimedia Foundation**.\n\nIt is a non-profit organization that supports Wikipedia and other free knowledge projects.",
  "Under which license is most Wikipedia content released?": "Most Wikipedia content is released under the **Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License** (CC BY-SA).\n\nSpecifically, it's often dual-licensed under:\n\n1.  **Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License (CC BY-SA 3.0)**\n2.  **Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License (CC BY-SA 4.0)** (for more recent contributions and as a preferred standard)\n3.  **GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL)** (due to a licensing migration in 2009, much content is still available under GFDL).\n\nHowever, if you have to pick one, **Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike (CC BY-SA)** is the primary and most commonly cited license for Wikipedia's text content.",
  "What software platform does Wikipedia run on?": "Wikipedia runs primarily on **MediaWiki**, which is a free and open-source wiki software application written in **PHP**.\n\nBeyond MediaWiki itself, the full software platform (often referred to as a \"stack\") includes:\n\n*   **Application Software:** **MediaWiki** (the wiki engine).\n*   **Programming Language:** **PHP**.\n*   **Database:** **MariaDB** (and previously MySQL). They also use other data stores like Cassandra for specific purposes.\n*   **Web Server:** Primarily **Nginx**, and **Apache Traffic Server** (ATS) for caching and reverse proxying.\n*   **Caching:** Extensive use of **Memcached** and **Redis** for in-memory caching to handle high traffic.\n*   **Search:** **Elasticsearch** is used for its powerful search capabilities.\n*   **Operating System:** **Linux** (specifically a mix of Ubuntu and Debian).\n\nSo, while **MediaWiki** is the core application, it relies on a robust and highly optimized stack of open-source technologies to handle its immense scale and traffic.",
  "How many articles does the English Wikipedia contain?": "As of my last update, the English Wikipedia contains **over 6.8 million** articles.\n\nThis number is constantly changing as new articles are created and others are merged or deleted. You can usually find the most up-to-date count on the main page of English Wikipedia or on its statistics page.",
  "How many total articles exist across all language editions?": "As of late May 2024, there are **over 62 million articles** across all language editions of Wikipedia.\n\nThis number is constantly growing, as new articles are created every minute.\n\nYou can find the most up-to-date statistics on the official Wikimedia Statistics page: [https://stats.wikimedia.org/](https://stats.wikimedia.org/)",
  "What was Nupedia and how is it related to Wikipedia?": "**Nupedia** was an ambitious, free online encyclopedia project founded by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger in March 2000. Its primary goal was to create a high-quality, English-language encyclopedia whose articles were written by subject matter experts and subjected to a rigorous, multi-stage peer-review process.\n\nHere's a breakdown of its characteristics:\n\n*   **Rigorous Editorial Process:** Unlike Wikipedia's open editing model, Nupedia had a seven-step approval process for articles, including initial submission, peer review, and final approval by the editor-in-chief. This was designed to ensure academic quality and reliability.\n*   **Slow Growth:** Due to its strict editorial process, article production was extremely slow. Over its entire lifespan, Nupedia published only a few dozen articles (around 24 completed articles and 150 in various stages of development).\n*   **Contributors:** Articles were written by volunteer scholars and experts.\n*   **Funding:** It was initially funded by Bomis, Jimmy Wales's web advertising company.\n\n---\n\n**How Nupedia is Related to Wikipedia:**\n\nThe relationship between Nupedia and Wikipedia is direct and foundational: **Wikipedia was initially conceived as a complementary, faster-paced project to help generate content for Nupedia.**\n\nHere's the timeline and the connection:\n\n1.  **Nupedia's Problem:** By late 2000, Nupedia's slow progress became apparent. The rigorous peer-review system, while ensuring quality, prevented the rapid accumulation of content.\n2.  **The Wiki Solution:** In January 2001, Larry Sanger, then Nupedia's editor-in-chief, proposed using a \"wiki\" \u2013 a type of website software that allows users to easily add, modify, or delete content collaboratively \u2013 as a way to quickly draft articles. The idea was that these \"rough\" wiki articles could then be refined and eventually submitted to Nupedia's more formal review process.\n3.  **Wikipedia's Birth:** Wikipedia was officially launched on January 15, 2001, primarily as a \"feeder\" project for Nupedia. Its initial purpose was to be a place for quick, informal collaboration on encyclopedia articles.\n4.  **Wikipedia's Rapid Growth:** To everyone's surprise, Wikipedia's open and collaborative model proved incredibly successful. Without the bottleneck of formal review, it rapidly accumulated thousands of articles in just a few months, far outpacing Nupedia.\n5.  **Nupedia's Decline:** As Wikipedia blossomed, Nupedia continued to struggle with its slow growth. Its purpose as the \"main\" encyclopedia was overshadowed by its dynamic, fast-growing offshoot.\n6.  **Nupedia's Closure:** Nupedia officially shut down in September 2003, with its content later integrated into Wikipedia.\n\nIn essence, Wikipedia emerged as a practical solution to Nupedia's content creation bottleneck. While Nupedia aimed for perfect, pre-vetted quality, Wikipedia embraced the idea of iterative improvement through mass collaboration. Wikipedia ultimately succeeded where Nupedia failed, achieving the goal of creating a massive, free online encyclopedia, but through a fundamentally different, and much more scalable, methodology.",
  "When did Wikipedia switch its domain from wikipedia.com to wikipedia.org?": "Wikipedia did not switch its primary domain from wikipedia.com to wikipedia.org.\n\n**Wikipedia was launched on **wikipedia.org** on January 15, 2001.**\n\nThe confusion might arise because:\n1.  **Nupedia**, the predecessor project to Wikipedia, was hosted on **nupedia.com**.\n2.  **wikipedia.com** does exist, but it **has always redirected to wikipedia.org** since Wikipedia's inception, primarily for defensive registration and user convenience.\n\nSo, the \".org\" domain has been Wikipedia's official and primary domain from day one, reflecting its non-profit, collaborative nature.",
  "How is Wikipedia funded and sustained financially?": "Wikipedia, and its sister projects, are primarily funded and sustained financially by the **Wikimedia Foundation**, a U.S.-based non-profit organization. Here's a breakdown of how it works:\n\n1.  **Primary Funding Source: Individual Donations**\n    *   **Annual Fundraising Campaigns:** The vast majority of Wikipedia's funding comes from millions of small, individual donations collected through their prominent on-site banner campaigns that appear annually (or more frequently) on Wikipedia pages. These banners often appeal directly to users to support the free knowledge they use.\n    *   **User-Supported Model:** This model is core to Wikipedia's philosophy \u2013 it's funded by its users, not by advertisers or corporate interests, which helps maintain its neutrality and independence.\n\n2.  **Secondary Funding Sources:**\n    *   **Major Donors and Grants:** The Wikimedia Foundation also receives grants from various philanthropic foundations, corporations (who often donate without specific influence over content), and high-net-worth individuals who support the mission of free knowledge.\n    *   **Wikimedia Endowment:** In 2016, the Wikimedia Endowment was established. This is a separate fund designed to provide long-term, stable financial support for Wikipedia and the Wikimedia projects, ensuring their sustainability far into the future. It operates similarly to a university endowment, with its principal invested and a portion of the earnings used for operations.\n    *   **Merchandise Sales:** While very minor in comparison, the Wikimedia Foundation does sell some merchandise (like T-shirts or mugs) through its online store, with proceeds supporting its operations.\n\n3.  **How the Money is Sustained and Used:**\n    The funds collected by the Wikimedia Foundation are primarily used to:\n\n    *   **Technical Infrastructure:** This is the largest expenditure. It covers servers, bandwidth, data centers, software development (for the MediaWiki platform and other tools), site reliability engineers, and cybersecurity to keep Wikipedia running 24/7 for hundreds of millions of users globally.\n    *   **Staff:** Employing a team of engineers, developers, legal experts, community support staff, fundraisers, communications specialists, and administrative personnel to manage the operations, support the volunteer community, and ensure legal compliance.\n    *   **Legal and Policy Work:** Protecting editors, safeguarding user privacy, defending against censorship, and advocating for free knowledge and open access around the world.\n    *   **Community Support and Grants:** Providing grants to Wikimedia chapters (local independent organizations that support Wikimedia projects), user groups, and individual volunteers for outreach, education, content creation, and events. This empowers the global volunteer community that actually writes and maintains the content.\n    *   **Product Development & Innovation:** Researching and developing new features, tools, and initiatives to improve the user experience, expand access to knowledge, and support the volunteer community.\n    *   **Outreach and Advocacy:** Promoting Wikipedia and its mission, fighting misinformation, and engaging in public discourse about the importance of free and reliable information.\n\n4.  **Key Pillars of Sustainability:**\n    *   **Non-Profit Model:** As a non-profit, the Wikimedia Foundation's goal is not to generate profit but to fulfill its mission.\n    *   **Vast Volunteer Base:** A huge factor in Wikipedia's sustainability is that the content itself is created and maintained by millions of unpaid volunteers worldwide. This dramatically reduces operating costs compared to any commercial encyclopedia that would need to pay content creators.\n    *   **Lean Operations:** While managing a website of Wikipedia's scale requires significant resources, the Foundation operates relatively leanly compared to for-profit tech companies with similar global reach.\n    *   **Transparency:** The Wikimedia Foundation publishes annual financial reports, detailing how donations are spent, which builds trust with donors.\n\nIn essence, Wikipedia is sustained by a unique model of widespread user support combined with dedicated staff and a global volunteer community, all driven by a shared mission of providing free access to knowledge. It conspicuously avoids advertising, which is a core principle to maintain its neutrality and user experience.",
  "What are some key milestones in Wikipedia\u2019s growth history?": "Wikipedia's growth has been phenomenal, transforming from a small side project into one of the most comprehensive and visited knowledge resources in human history. Here are some key milestones:\n\n1.  **January 15, 2001: Wikipedia Launches.**\n    *   A spin-off of Nupedia (a slower, expert-written encyclopedia), Wikipedia was created by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger to be a fast, collaborative, and \"wiki\"-based complement. This date marks the birth of the project.\n\n2.  **February 12, 2001: English Wikipedia Reaches 1,000 Articles.**\n    *   Rapid early growth demonstrated the power of the wiki concept.\n\n3.  **September 7, 2001: English Wikipedia Reaches 10,000 Articles.**\n    *   Continued exponential growth, showing strong community adoption.\n\n4.  **October 2002: Wiki Travel (Wikitravel) Launches.**\n    *   While not officially part of Wikimedia initially (it later inspired Wikivoyage), this showed the broader applicability of the wiki model to other types of information.\n\n5.  **June 20, 2003: Wikimedia Foundation is Established.**\n    *   Founded by Jimmy Wales, this non-profit organization provides the essential infrastructure and legal framework for Wikipedia and its sister projects, ensuring its long-term stability and non-commercial nature.\n\n6.  **September 7, 2004: Wikimedia Commons Launches.**\n    *   A central repository for free-use images, sound, and video files, Commons became crucial for enriching articles across all language Wikipedias and sister projects, fostering a truly multilingual and multimedia encyclopedia.\n\n7.  **March 18, 2005: English Wikipedia Reaches 500,000 Articles.**\n    *   Demonstrates the project's increasing scale and community engagement.\n\n8.  **September 20, 2005: English Wikipedia Reaches 1 Million Articles.**\n    *   A massive achievement, solidifying its position as the largest encyclopedia ever created by sheer volume.\n\n9.  **Early 2007: Wikipedia Consistently Ranks Among Top 10 Most Visited Websites Globally.**\n    *   This marks its transition from a niche online project to a mainstream, globally recognized source of information.\n\n10. **August 17, 2009: English Wikipedia Reaches 3 Million Articles.**\n    *   Continued robust growth, even as the project matured.\n\n11. **October 30, 2012: Wikidata Launches.**\n    *   A monumental step for structured data. Wikidata provides a central, multilingual repository of structured data that can be used by Wikipedia and other Wikimedia projects, as well as external sites, improving consistency and data retrieval across languages.\n\n12. **July 13, 2012: English Wikipedia Reaches 4 Million Articles.**\n\n13. **November 1, 2015: English Wikipedia Reaches 5 Million Articles.**\n\n14. **January 23, 2020: English Wikipedia Reaches 6 Million Articles.**\n\n15. **August 2022: Total Wikipedia Articles (across all languages) Exceed 60 Million.**\n    *   This global figure highlights the incredible scale and diversity of the project, with articles in hundreds of languages.\n\n16. **Ongoing: Focus on Quality, Reliability, and Combating Misinformation.**\n    *   While not a single milestone, the continuous evolution of policies, community tools (like bots, peer review, and dispute resolution), and the development of AI/ML tools to assist editors in maintaining quality and fighting vandalism and misinformation are crucial \"growth\" milestones in terms of maturity and impact.\n\nThese milestones collectively paint a picture of Wikipedia's remarkable journey from a nascent idea to an indispensable global knowledge utility.",
  "Which countries account for the largest share of Wikipedia\u2019s traffic?": "The countries that consistently account for the largest share of Wikipedia's traffic are primarily those with large populations, high internet penetration, and/or a strong English-speaking user base (as English Wikipedia is the largest):\n\n1.  **United States:** Consistently the top country by a significant margin, largely due to its large English-speaking population and early internet adoption.\n2.  **Germany:** Very high traffic, reflecting strong usage of the German Wikipedia and high internet penetration.\n3.  **Japan:** Also a very strong contributor, with a dedicated Japanese Wikipedia and a large online population.\n4.  **United Kingdom:** Naturally high due to its English-speaking population.\n5.  **France:** Significant traffic, driven by the French Wikipedia.\n6.  **Canada:** High due to both English and French speakers.\n7.  **Italy:** Reflects strong usage of the Italian Wikipedia.\n\nOther countries like **India** and **Brazil** are growing rapidly in terms of internet users and are becoming increasingly significant, though they might not always be in the absolute top 5 for *share* yet. **China** is a notable exception due to the Great Firewall, which blocks access to Wikipedia, so it accounts for very little direct traffic despite its massive population.\n\nIt's important to note that the exact ranking can fluctuate slightly over time and depending on the specific metrics (e.g., page views vs. unique visitors). However, the U.S., Germany, Japan, and the UK are almost always at the top.",
  "How did Wikipedia first gain contributors in its early days?": "Wikipedia's early growth in contributors was a fascinating organic process, driven by a unique combination of technical innovation, a clear vision, and the dynamics of the early internet. Here's how it happened:\n\n1.  **The Nupedia Origin and Frustration:** Wikipedia was initially conceived in January 2001 by Larry Sanger (then editor-in-chief of Nupedia) and Jimmy Wales (founder of Bomis, Nupedia's parent company) as a complementary project to **Nupedia**. Nupedia was a slow, peer-reviewed encyclopedia project that struggled to gain content quickly due to its rigorous, academic-style editorial process. Sanger suggested using a wiki to rapidly develop articles that could then be polished for Nupedia.\n\n2.  **The \"Wiki\" Advantage \u2013 Low Barrier to Entry:** This was perhaps the single most important factor.\n    *   **Ease of Editing:** The wiki software (initially UseModWiki, later MediaWiki) made it incredibly easy for anyone to edit an article by simply clicking an \"edit\" button. No special software, no complex coding, no lengthy sign-up process (initially, editing was even possible without creating an account).\n    *   **Instant Gratification:** Edits were live instantly. This provided immediate feedback and a sense of accomplishment for new contributors.\n    *   **Collaborative Nature:** It implicitly encouraged collaboration, as anyone could add to or improve upon someone else's work.\n\n3.  **Word-of-Mouth and Early Adopters:**\n    *   **Nupedia Contributors:** The first wave of contributors largely came from the existing Nupedia community, frustrated by its slow pace, and tech-savvy individuals who were already interested in online knowledge projects.\n    *   **Tech Forums and Mailing Lists:** Wikipedia was discussed and promoted in various online forums, mailing lists, and communities of early internet users, open-source enthusiasts, and academics. This generated an initial buzz among people who understood the potential of collaborative online projects.\n    *   **Lack of Alternatives:** In the early 2000s, there weren't many free, comprehensive online encyclopedias. Encyclopedia Britannica had an online presence, but it wasn't editable or free. Wikipedia filled a significant void.\n\n4.  **The \"Fix It\" Mentality and Appeal to Expertise:**\n    *   **Correcting Errors:** Many early contributors were drawn in by seeing an error or omission in an article and feeling empowered to correct or add information themselves. It tapped into a natural human desire to improve things they saw as imperfect.\n    *   **Sharing Knowledge:** People with expertise or strong interests in specific subjects found a platform where they could easily contribute their knowledge to the world, often on topics not covered in traditional encyclopedias.\n    *   **\"Build It\" Mentality:** There was a pioneering spirit among early contributors who relished the idea of building a vast, free repository of knowledge from scratch.\n\n5.  **The Vision of \"Free Knowledge for All\":**\n    *   **Ideological Alignment:** The project's core mission \u2013 to create a free encyclopedia for everyone, mirroring the ideals of the open-source movement \u2013 resonated deeply with many people. They saw it as a public service and an act of digital altruism.\n    *   **Democratization of Information:** The idea that knowledge shouldn't be locked behind paywalls or controlled by a select few experts was very appealing.\n\n6.  **Community Building and Retention:**\n    *   **Talk Pages and Project Pages:** While anyone could edit, early contributors quickly formed a community through talk pages, where they discussed article content, policies, and project direction.\n    *   **Mailing Lists and IRC:** Dedicated mailing lists and IRC channels allowed core contributors to communicate more extensively, fostering a sense of camaraderie and shared purpose.\n    *   **Shared Ownership:** As people invested more time and effort, they developed a sense of ownership over the project, motivating them to recruit others and refine the platform.\n\nIn essence, Wikipedia's early growth was an emergent phenomenon. It combined a highly accessible platform with a compelling vision and a burgeoning online community eager to contribute to something meaningful and collaborative. It wasn't about marketing campaigns, but about harnessing the collective power of interested individuals on the early internet.",
  "What is the relationship between Wikipedia and the GNU FDL?": "Wikipedia and the GNU Free Documentation License (GNU FDL or GFDL) have a **historical and foundational, but no longer primary, relationship.**\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n1.  **Early Adoption and Alignment:**\n    *   **Foundational License:** For many years, especially in its early and formative period (from 2002 until mid-2009), *all* text content on Wikipedia was primarily licensed under the GNU FDL.\n    *   **Why GFDL?** The GNU FDL was chosen because it was one of the few licenses available at the time that embodied the \"free\" principles of the Free Software Foundation (FSF), particularly \"copyleft.\" This meant that anyone could freely use, distribute, and modify Wikipedia's content, provided they maintained the same freedoms for derivative works. This aligned perfectly with Wikipedia's mission to create a free and openly accessible encyclopedia.\n\n2.  **Challenges and Limitations of GFDL for Wikipedia:**\n    *   **Complexity for Re-users:** The GFDL, designed primarily for software documentation, had very specific requirements for redistribution, especially the \"transparent copy\" and \"invariant sections\" clauses. For instance, to redistribute GFDL-licensed text in print, one would ideally have to include the full GFDL license, potentially a list of all contributors, and other specific disclaimers. This made it cumbersome for commercial or even non-commercial re-users (e.g., printing books based on Wikipedia content, or distributing it on CD-ROMs).\n    *   **Incompatibility with Other Free Licenses:** A major problem was that the GFDL was largely incompatible with many other \"free culture\" licenses, particularly the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike (CC BY-SA) license. This hindered collaboration and content sharing between Wikipedia and other free content projects, which often used CC licenses.\n\n3.  **The Migration to Creative Commons:**\n    *   **Community Consensus:** Recognizing these limitations, the Wikimedia Foundation (the organization that hosts Wikipedia) and the Wikipedia community engaged in a long and extensive discussion about migrating the licensing.\n    *   **The \"Licensing Update\" (2009):** In June 2009, after a community vote, Wikipedia transitioned its primary licensing for text content from the GNU FDL to the **Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License (CC BY-SA 3.0)**.\n    *   **Dual-Licensing:** To facilitate this transition and acknowledge past contributions, Wikipedia content that was previously solely GFDL-licensed became **dual-licensed** under both the GFDL and CC BY-SA 3.0. New content added since then is primarily licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0.\n\n**In summary:**\n\n*   **Past:** The GNU FDL was Wikipedia's primary license for text content for many years, underpinning its \"free knowledge\" principles.\n*   **Present:** While older content retains an option for GFDL licensing (due to dual-licensing), the **Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike (CC BY-SA)** is now the *primary and preferred license* for all text content on Wikipedia.\n*   **Relationship Today:** The GFDL remains part of Wikipedia's licensing history and is still an *option* for re-use of older content, but CC BY-SA is the main standard due to its greater flexibility and compatibility within the broader free culture movement.",
  "When did Wikipedia surpass the Yongle Encyclopedia in article count?": "It's tricky to give an exact date because the \"article count\" of the Yongle Encyclopedia isn't directly comparable to Wikipedia's in the same way.\n\nHere's why and the general timeline:\n\n1.  **Yongle Encyclopedia's Structure:** The Yongle Encyclopedia (completed in 1408) was a massive compilation of existing literature, historical texts, and other knowledge. It was organized into **11,095 volumes** (or fascicles) and **22,877 chapters (juan)**. It wasn't structured as discrete, individual \"articles\" in the modern sense like Wikipedia. Each \"chapter\" might contain multiple texts or excerpts. There isn't an agreed-upon \"article count\" for it.\n\n2.  **Wikipedia's Structure:** Wikipedia consists of millions of discrete, hyperlinked articles, each generally focusing on a specific topic.\n\n**However, if we were to make a rough conceptual comparison:**\n\nEven if you consider each of the Yongle Encyclopedia's ~22,877 chapters (juan) as a conceptual \"article\" (which is a stretch, as many chapters are very long and contain multiple sub-topics), Wikipedia's English edition alone surpassed that number relatively early in its development.\n\n*   **English Wikipedia Milestones:**\n    *   Hit **100,000 articles** in early 2003.\n    *   Hit **500,000 articles** in December 2004.\n    *   Hit **1,000,000 articles** in March 2006.\n\nGiven that the Yongle Encyclopedia has ~22,877 chapters, the **English Wikipedia likely surpassed that number of \"articles\" sometime in late 2003 or early 2004.**\n\nBy the time the English Wikipedia hit its 1 millionth article in 2006, it had undoubtedly far exceeded any reasonable interpretation of the Yongle Encyclopedia's \"article count.\" If you consider all language editions of Wikipedia combined, that number was surpassed even earlier.",
  "What is systemic bias on Wikipedia and what forms does it take?": "Systemic bias on Wikipedia refers to the **inherent, non-deliberate skew or imbalance in its content, contributors, and processes** that results from the way the platform is structured, the demographics of its editor base, and the nature of its source material, rather than from deliberate malice or individual prejudice.\n\nIt's \"systemic\" because it's baked into the very system of how Wikipedia operates, reflecting and amplifying biases present in the wider world, rather than being the fault of a few bad actors.\n\n### Forms Systemic Bias Takes on Wikipedia:\n\nSystemic bias manifests in several interconnected ways:\n\n1.  **Gender Bias:** This is perhaps the most well-known form.\n    *   **Fewer Biographies of Women:** There are significantly fewer articles about women than men.\n    *   **Content Skew in Biographies:** Articles about women often disproportionately focus on their relationships, appearance, or personal lives, rather than their professional achievements, compared to articles about men.\n    *   **Fewer Women Editors:** The overwhelming majority of Wikipedia editors identify as male (estimates vary, but often cited as 85-90%). This naturally influences what topics are considered important, how they are framed, and which sources are prioritized.\n\n2.  **Geographic/Cultural Bias (Global North/Western Bias):**\n    *   **Over-representation of Western Topics:** Content tends to be heavily weighted towards topics, events, and people from Western countries (especially the U.S., UK, and Western Europe).\n    *   **Under-representation of the Global South:** Information about Africa, Latin America, parts of Asia, and indigenous cultures is often sparse or non-existent. This is partly due to fewer editors from these regions and a scarcity of easily accessible, \"reliable\" sources in Western academic or media contexts.\n    *   **Perspective Skew:** Even when topics from non-Western regions are covered, they may be presented from a Western perspective, potentially overlooking local nuances, historical interpretations, or cultural significance.\n\n3.  **Topic/Subject Matter Bias:**\n    *   **Preference for \"Fannish\" Topics:** Subjects related to popular culture, video games, anime, science fiction, and tech often have extensive, detailed coverage, reflecting the interests of the predominantly young, male, tech-savvy editor base.\n    *   **Under-representation of Humanities and Social Sciences:** Topics in areas like local history, art history, philosophy, and sociology may be less comprehensively covered.\n    *   **Bias Towards STEM:** Scientific, technological, engineering, and mathematical topics tend to be well-covered, again aligning with editor demographics.\n\n4.  **Source Bias:**\n    *   **Reliance on Published, Mainstream Sources:** Wikipedia's core policies of \"verifiability\" and \"reliable sources\" heavily favor published, mainstream academic, journalistic, or institutional sources.\n    *   **Exclusion of Oral Traditions/Local Knowledge:** This inherently disadvantages topics where knowledge is primarily transmitted through oral traditions, local community records, or non-peer-reviewed scholarship, which might not be considered \"reliable\" by Wikipedia's standards.\n    *   **Language Bias in Sourcing:** English Wikipedia editors often prefer English-language sources, even when more authoritative non-English sources exist.\n\n5.  **Demographic Bias in the Editor Community:**\n    *   **Lack of Diversity:** As mentioned, the editing community is predominantly male, highly educated, from the Global North, and technically proficient.\n    *   **\"Chilly Climate\":** The often-confrontational or rule-bound nature of editing, the complex jargon, and sometimes unwelcoming atmosphere can deter new editors, especially those from underrepresented groups. This perpetuates the existing demographic imbalance.\n    *   **Consensus Reflects Majority:** Decisions on content, notability, and policy are made by consensus, which can inadvertently reflect the biases and perspectives of the dominant demographic.\n\n6.  **Policy and Structural Biases:**\n    *   **Notability Criteria:** What makes a topic \"notable\" enough for an article often depends on whether it has received \"significant coverage in reliable sources.\" This creates a feedback loop: if marginalized communities or women's achievements aren't covered by mainstream media (which themselves may be biased), they struggle to meet Wikipedia's notability criteria.\n    *   **Neutral Point of View (NPOV):** While a foundational policy, achieving \"neutrality\" can be biased if the \"mainstream\" or \"dominant\" view presented as neutral is itself a product of underlying societal biases, or if alternative perspectives lack sufficient \"reliable\" sources to be adequately represented.\n\n**Why it Matters:**\n\nWikipedia is one of the most widely accessed information sources globally. These systemic biases mean that the \"sum of all human knowledge\" it aims to represent is incomplete, skewed, and potentially reinforces real-world inequalities and misrepresentations. While Wikipedia and the Wikimedia Foundation are actively working to address these biases through initiatives like \"WikiProject Women in Red\" (creating articles about women), editor outreach programs, and policy discussions, it remains an ongoing and significant challenge.",
  "What does the 'neutral point-of-view' policy entail?": "The **Neutral Point-of-View (NPOV)** policy is a foundational principle, most famously used in projects like Wikipedia, but applicable to any endeavor aiming to present information fairly and objectively. It dictates that all encyclopedic content must be written from a neutral point of view, representing fairly, proportionately, and without bias, all significant views published by reliable sources.\n\nHere's what NPOV entails:\n\n1.  **Presenting All Significant Views:**\n    *   NPOV doesn't mean having *no* point of view, but rather presenting *all* significant, verifiable points of view that have been published by reliable sources.\n    *   It acknowledges that for many topics, there isn't a single \"truth\" but rather different interpretations or perspectives.\n\n2.  **Impartiality and Objectivity:**\n    *   The goal is to write articles or content in a way that is impartial and does not advocate for any particular side or opinion.\n    *   The *writer* or editor must remain neutral, even if the *subject* itself is highly controversial or partisan.\n\n3.  **Attribution and Verifiability:**\n    *   Controversial assertions of all kinds, whether relating to a religious doctrine, a political policy, or an alleged crime, should be attributed to their sources.\n    *   Instead of stating something as fact, you state *who* claims it as fact: \"According to Dr. Smith...\", \"Many scholars believe...\", \"The XYZ report concluded that...\".\n    *   All claims should be verifiable through reliable sources.\n\n4.  **\"Due Weight\" and Avoiding False Balance:**\n    *   **Due Weight:** NPOV requires that all views are presented with a prominence that reflects their prominence in reliable published sources. A majority view should generally get more space and detail than a significant minority view, and tiny minority or fringe views should get little or no space unless they are historically significant or widely discussed in their own right.\n    *   **Avoiding False Balance:** This means not giving equal validity or space to a widely accepted mainstream view and a discredited or fringe view. For example, presenting the scientific consensus on climate change with the same weight as a climate change denial theory would be a violation of NPOV, as it creates a false sense of equivalency where none exists in the broader body of reliable knowledge.\n\n5.  **Focus on Facts and Evidence, Not Beliefs:**\n    *   The content should be based on facts and evidence as presented in reliable sources, rather than the personal beliefs, experiences, or opinions of the writer.\n    *   It's about summarizing what reliable sources say, not engaging in original research or expressing personal synthesis.\n\n6.  **Neutral Language:**\n    *   Use language that is free from loaded terms, pejoratives, or sensationalism.\n    *   Avoid language that expresses approval or disapproval. For example, instead of saying \"the ridiculous claim,\" you would say \"the claim, which has been widely criticized by experts.\"\n\n**What NPOV is NOT:**\n\n*   **Absence of Controversial Information:** NPOV doesn't mean avoiding controversial topics or sanitizing information. On the contrary, it means presenting controversies by fairly representing the various significant viewpoints on them.\n*   **\"Compromise\" or \"Middle Ground\":** It's not about finding a happy medium between two extreme views. It's about accurately reporting the range of significant views, even if some are extreme.\n*   **Achieving \"Truth\":** NPOV doesn't aim to determine ultimate \"truth.\" Instead, it aims to describe *what is said about* the truth from reliable sources, recognizing that different people or groups may have different understandings of it.\n\nIn essence, the NPOV policy aims to create content that is trustworthy, balanced, and allows readers to form their own conclusions based on a comprehensive and fairly presented range of information.",
  "What criticisms has Wikipedia faced regarding bias?": "Wikipedia, despite its stated goal of Neutral Point of View (NPOV), has faced extensive criticism regarding various forms of bias. These criticisms often stem from its open-editing model, the demographics of its contributors, its reliance on \"reliable sources,\" and the very nature of knowledge construction.\n\nHere are the main types of bias criticisms Wikipedia has faced:\n\n1.  **Gender Bias:**\n    *   **Underrepresentation of Women:** There are significantly fewer biographies of women compared to men, and articles on topics traditionally associated with women (e.g., fashion designers, social workers, specific artistic movements) may be less developed or considered less \"notable\" than those associated with men (e.g., scientists, politicians, military figures).\n    *   **Lack of Female Editors:** The vast majority of Wikipedia editors are male, which can unconsciously lead to topics, sources, and writing styles that appeal more to men or reflect male perspectives.\n    *   **\"Notability\" Criteria:** Critics argue that Wikipedia's \"notability\" guidelines, which require \"significant coverage in reliable secondary sources,\" implicitly favor topics and individuals who have historically received more media and academic attention, which has often been men.\n\n2.  **Geographic/Cultural Bias (Western/Global North Bias):**\n    *   **Overrepresentation of Western Topics:** Articles tend to focus disproportionately on topics, history, culture, and individuals from Western countries, particularly the United States and Europe.\n    *   **Underrepresentation of Global South/Non-Western Content:** There is a significant lack of coverage, or less detailed coverage, of topics and perspectives from Africa, Asia (outside of a few major countries), Latin America, and Indigenous cultures.\n    *   **Editor Demographics:** Most active editors reside in Western countries, leading to a natural emphasis on familiar topics and access to local sources.\n    *   **Language Bias:** While there are Wikipedias in many languages, the English Wikipedia is the largest and most influential. Its content and standards often influence other language versions, and sources for non-Western topics may be less accessible in English.\n\n3.  **Political/Ideological Bias:**\n    *   **Perceived Liberal Leanings:** Some conservative critics argue that Wikipedia articles, especially on political, social, and scientific topics (e.g., climate change, evolution, social justice issues), exhibit a liberal or left-wing bias. This is sometimes attributed to the perceived political leanings of the editor base and the sources considered \"reliable.\"\n    *   **Perceived Conservative Leanings:** Conversely, some progressive critics might argue that certain articles or their framing reflect a status quo or conservative bias, particularly when mainstream media (often cited as reliable sources) themselves have certain leanings.\n    *   **\"Notability\" and Source Selection:** Debates often arise over which sources are \"reliable\" on controversial topics, and what constitutes \"due weight\" for different viewpoints, leading to accusations of bias in how competing narratives are presented.\n\n4.  **Systemic Bias / Notability Bias:**\n    *   **Bias Towards Established Knowledge:** Wikipedia's reliance on \"reliable, published sources\" means it tends to reflect and reinforce existing knowledge structures. New ideas, fringe theories (even if potentially valid but not yet widely accepted), or local/community-based knowledge that hasn't been widely published in mainstream media or academia struggle to gain traction.\n    *   **Bias Towards \"Hard Facts\" and \"Objective\" Science:** There can be a bias towards scientific consensus and quantifiable data, sometimes at the expense of qualitative experiences, spiritual beliefs, or Indigenous knowledge systems, which may not fit easily into the verifiability criteria.\n    *   **Bias Towards Popular Culture/Mass Media:** Due to the abundance of published sources, topics from popular culture (e.g., specific anime episodes, minor characters in TV shows, obscure video games) can sometimes receive more detailed coverage than topics of significant academic, historical, or social importance.\n\n5.  **Commercial/PR Bias (Paid Editing):**\n    *   **Promotional Content:** Companies, public relations firms, or individuals sometimes attempt to edit articles about themselves or their products to remove negative information, exaggerate positive aspects, or insert promotional material. While Wikipedia has strict policies against undisclosed paid editing, it remains an ongoing challenge.\n    *   **Conflict of Interest:** Editors with a direct financial or personal interest in a topic may attempt to manipulate content, leading to a biased presentation.\n\n**Why these biases exist and persist:**\n\n*   **Editor Demographics:** As a volunteer project, the demographic makeup of its active editors (predominantly young to middle-aged, educated, male, from the Global North) inevitably shapes the content.\n*   **\"Reliable Sources\" Interpretation:** While meant to ensure accuracy, the definition and selection of \"reliable sources\" can themselves be subject to bias, as mainstream media and academic institutions can have their own biases.\n*   **Consensus-Based Editing:** Achieving consensus among a diverse group of editors can be challenging, especially on controversial topics. The \"loudest\" or most persistent voices can sometimes disproportionately influence an article's content.\n*   **Reflecting Real-World Biases:** To some extent, Wikipedia's biases reflect the biases present in the wider world, in publishing, media, academia, and historical record-keeping.\n\nWikipedia's community is generally aware of these criticisms and continually works to mitigate these biases through policies (like NPOV and conflict of interest), outreach efforts (e.g., edit-a-thons focused on underrepresented groups), and community discussions. However, given the project's scale and open nature, these biases remain persistent challenges.",
  "How did Wikipedia\u2019s editor count change between 2008 and 2009?": "Wikipedia's editor count for the English Wikipedia, after reaching its peak around 2007-2008, began to experience a **slight decrease or plateau** between 2008 and 2009.\n\nWhile the most dramatic decline in active editors occurred in later years, this period marked the beginning of a shift from continuous growth:\n\n*   **2008:** The active editor count (often defined as making at least 5 edits per month) was near its peak, generally cited in the range of **85,000 to 90,000**.\n*   **2009:** This number saw a modest reduction, often cited in the range of **80,000 to 85,000**.\n\nSo, the editor count generally **declined slightly** or **stagnated** from its peak during this period, rather than continuing to grow as it had in previous years.",
  "What was the significance of the 2012 SOPA/PIPA blackout?": "The 2012 SOPA/PIPA blackout was a **watershed moment** in the history of the internet and digital activism, marking the first time that a broad coalition of major online platforms and millions of users successfully mobilized to defeat proposed legislation. Its significance can be broken down into several key areas:\n\n1.  **Demonstrated the Internet's Political Power:**\n    *   **Unprecedented Mobilization:** Websites like Wikipedia, Reddit, Mozilla, WordPress, and many others \"blacked out\" or displayed prominent protest messages on January 18, 2012. This direct action reached tens of millions of users.\n    *   **Mass Public Engagement:** The blackout made a complex legislative issue tangible and immediate to everyday internet users. It provided clear calls to action, directing users to contact their elected officials.\n    *   **Overwhelmed Congress:** Congressional offices were inundated with phone calls, emails, and faxes from constituents demanding that their representatives oppose the bills. This grassroots pressure proved more effective than traditional lobbying in this instance.\n    *   **Shifted Political Support:** Many co-sponsors of SOPA and PIPA, facing immense public backlash, withdrew their support, ultimately leading to the bills being shelved indefinitely.\n\n2.  **Raised Public Awareness of Internet Policy:**\n    *   Before SOPA/PIPA, many internet users were unaware of the legislative processes that could affect the structure and freedom of the web. The blackout brought issues like DNS blocking, safe harbor provisions, and the potential for internet censorship into mainstream public discourse.\n    *   It helped educate a generation of internet users about the importance of an open and free internet, laying the groundwork for future battles over issues like net neutrality and online privacy.\n\n3.  **Empowered Internet Companies and Users:**\n    *   The protest showed that internet companies, when united with their user base, could be a formidable political force, capable of countering the powerful lobbying efforts of established industries like Hollywood and the music industry.\n    *   It gave users a sense of agency, demonstrating that their collective voice could directly influence legislative outcomes.\n\n4.  **Set a Precedent for Future Digital Activism:**\n    *   The success of the SOPA/PIPA blackout became a blueprint for future online protests and advocacy campaigns. It established digital activism as a legitimate and powerful tool for influencing policy.\n    *   Its tactics were later adapted and used in struggles over issues like net neutrality (e.g., the \"Break the Internet\" protest in 2017) and other internet freedom initiatives.\n\n5.  **Reaffirmed the Principles of an Open Internet:**\n    *   The defeat of SOPA/PIPA was seen by many as a victory for the principles of an open, decentralized, and censorship-resistant internet. Opponents argued the bills would have stifled innovation, limited free expression, and given too much power to corporations to control online content.\n\nIn summary, the 2012 SOPA/PIPA blackout was significant because it dramatically showcased the political power of the internet and its users, transformed public awareness of internet policy issues, and set a powerful precedent for future digital activism in defense of an open and free web.",
  "How many active device visits does Wikipedia attract per month?": "According to the Wikimedia Foundation's own statistics, Wikipedia attracts **over 1.5 billion unique devices** per month.\n\nIt's important to distinguish this from page views:\n\n*   **Unique Devices:** Over 1.5 billion unique devices (or clients) visit Wikipedia monthly. This number attempts to count distinct devices accessing the site.\n*   **Page Views:** The total number of page views is much higher, typically around **15 billion page views per month**, as each unique device might view many pages.\n\nThese figures highlight Wikipedia's massive global reach and impact.",
  "What happened with the Vector 2022 site redesign?": "The \"Vector 2022 site redesign\" was less of a redesign and more of a **complete transformation and effective dismantling of what the old Vector.com site was, leading to significant community backlash.**\n\nHere's what happened:\n\n1.  **What Vector.com Was (Pre-2022):** For many years, Vector.com was a highly valued resource for digital artists, particularly those working with vector graphics. It was known for:\n    *   In-depth tutorials and articles on Adobe Illustrator, CorelDRAW, Affinity Designer, and other vector software.\n    *   A vibrant community forum where artists could ask questions, share tips, and get feedback.\n    *   Showcases of vector art and artists.\n    *   Free resources like brushes, patterns, and icons.\n    *   It was seen as a learning hub and a place for inspiration and connection within the vector art community.\n\n2.  **The Change (Late 2022/Early 2023):** Sometime around late 2022 or early 2023, the site underwent a dramatic overhaul. This wasn't just a UI update; the entire **content and purpose of the site changed overnight.**\n    *   **Loss of Content:** The vast majority of the old tutorials, articles, and community forum disappeared or became inaccessible. Years of valuable educational content were effectively erased from public view.\n    *   **Shift in Focus:** The new Vector.com became a much more generic, commercially-oriented site, primarily focused on directing users to stock vector asset sites (like Adobe Stock, Freepik, Shutterstock, etc.) or offering generic \"what is vector art\" type articles that often contained affiliate links. It essentially turned into a content farm/affiliate marketing portal.\n    *   **Loss of Community:** The community forums and any interactive elements were removed, leaving the long-standing user base without their platform.\n\n3.  **User Reaction and Aftermath:** The change was met with widespread **outcry, frustration, and sadness** from the vector art community.\n    *   Users felt blindsided, as there was little to no warning or explanation for such a drastic pivot.\n    *   Many mourned the loss of a unique and valuable free resource, lamenting that years of accumulated knowledge and community interaction were gone.\n    *   The new site was widely criticized for its lack of original content, its commercial nature, and its failure to serve the needs of the community it once fostered.\n\nIn essence, the \"Vector 2022 site redesign\" was the death of a beloved community and learning resource, replaced by a much more generic, commercialized entity that bears little resemblance to its former self. Many artists had to seek out alternative communities and learning platforms.",
